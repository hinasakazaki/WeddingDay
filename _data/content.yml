      [Hina](http://hinasakazaki.com) first spotted [Chris](http://notyetsecure.com) at a joint UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra and University Chorus concert rehearsal while checking for cute faces in the choir during long rests in the music. Chris caught her eye, with his straight posture, music held up high, rosy cheeks, and spirited expressions while singing.
      
      It did not end there. She got his phone number through a clarinet player who also sang baritone next to Chris in the choir, but waited to finish her finals to text. A week passed, Chris making little of the event.
      
      When the finals were all done, Hina texted the number, expressing her interest to get to know him.
      
      First coffee, then dinner; it started with mutual interest in [Garrus Vakarian](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Garrus_Vakarian) from the Mass Effect series, and expanded to music, games, computer science, bad movies, good anime, bad anime, good movies, worse anime, game mechanics, abstract syntax trees, gender, family planning, et c.
      
      After four and a half years, Hina popped the question with a [game](http://hinasakazaki.com/post/everyday/) that she made specifically for him (but you can play too). Chris chose the option "sure" when the Hina character proposed to the Chris character, and said "Yes, I'll marry you", when the real Hina proposed to him in person. He has said yes every time Hina asked since then, so they are getting married, unless at some point, they change their mind!
